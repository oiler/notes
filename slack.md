# Slack Guidelines


## Mission

These notes are intended to act as guidelines (and not rules). Every company is different, and every team has its own dynamic. But as the number of users of any Slack team grows, so does the number of different expectations people have of it. This document is an attempt to set forth a set of guidelines that a team _could_ adopt, in order to set the tone for how conversations should happen. 

For many, the introduction of Slack into the workplace has added a new layer of demand for attention, distraction, and worry. 

If you've ever seen a coworker who's Slack app is filled with unread notifications, then Slack is failing your team. If you are someone who's Slack app is filled with unread notifications, then Slack is failing you. If you know of a channel in Slack where a single message posted can hijack an entire day's work for everyone in the channel, Slack is failing your company. Only by resetting expectations — across the entire organization — for how Slack communication should be used, can you allow the tool to benefit — and not hurt — your team's communication.

## Top Principles

* Understand that when you DM or @ mention someone, most people will by default receive this as an urgent message from you. As much as you can, label the direct messages that dont require immediate attention as such.
* Don't do work in DMs. Don't leave Group DM threads unlabeled. Use channels.
* It's okay to close Slack for periods of time. It's okay to not be available every second of the day. Just make sure there's a way to let your colleagues know when you're away (ie, shared calendar, status update, post message in public room).
* Strictly limit Slack usage in meetings; it should only be open for on-topic discussions. If Slack didn't exist, and in every meeting you had everyone was in the same room with you, how likely are you to randomly walk out of the room and talk to people who happen to be passing by? That answer should be your guide for where you give your attention in meetings. It's ok to think through ideas until you're bored. Don't read Slack just because the meeting conversation doesn't apply to you. "Sorry, can you repeat that" is one of the rudest things you can say to your colleagues.


## Channel Usage

### Principles
* Most of the discussions in Slack should be public.  
* If the majority of your org's conversations are happing in DMs or private channels, you're probably using Slack in a way that will burn people out, end up being worse than email, and/or that leads to an inability to elevate urgent topics when required.
* When starting a new discussion, default your choice to creating a public room. Only consider using another options if there's a legitimate reason.
* If there's stuff you're talking about in private channels that you are afraid others will see, perhaps you should reconsider typing them into your organization's Slack at all. Remember who ultimately owns the text you type into chat. It's no different than sending an email. Expect that anyone can and will eventually read it.

### Public Channels
Use them all of the time. Well, ok, most of the time. Distributed teams (multiple offices, remote workers, etc) rely on a type of asynchronous communication that requires a high level of transparency and discoverability. A culture that predominantly uses public channels creates this type of environment.

### Direct Messages 
Obviously, these are good when you need to talk to someone directly. But consider more closely what your communications are about? Are they project specific? How easily will you be able to find that thing you were talking about two weeks ago about that other thing? Maybe a project specific channel would have been a better place? 

### Private Channel
These are equal to closed door meetings. People notice when they walk by that a door is closed. Having too many closed doors makes people (rightfully) suspicious.

### Group DMs
Apply the same description as a private channel, except add in that the user experience here is terrible. Ask, what is this group for? Why does it exist? Is it to organize the same group of people who always get coffee at 4pm? Whatever the reason, click the link that says "convert to private channel" and take it there. Searching for the right group DM in Slack is one of its worst "features".


## Channel Structure

### Principles
* Namespacing channels are a great way to add heirarchy and group similar channels together. Be consistent.
* Keep most of your project specific discussion out of your team/department channels. Team channels should be used as a watercooler for that team, and more importantly as a way for people outside the team to find and approach this group for help. If they see a bunch of project specific talk about something, they are less likely to walk into the room and ask for help.

### Heirarchy
* Heirarchy and grouping should be organized around:
  * Organizational (HR, Ask the CEO, General, etc)
  * Team or department specific (Design, Product, etc)
  * Location based (New York office, Remote workers, etc)
  * Topic based (Google Analytics, Coffee, Cute Pets, etc)
  * Project based (Homepage redesign, Current Sprint, etc)
  * Other

### Simultaneous topics
* Team rooms are a place for open chatter, but dont start a new topic if there's one already happening
* Using project specific channels helps alleviate simultaneous conversations
* Start new channels like you would create a new JIRA ticket for something
* Archive the channel when the project is done (and link to the channel in the actual JIRA ticket)

Here's a visualization for how your team could be organized. Work is done in project channels. Team channels are public facing and welcoming for outsiders.
![Slack Channel Viz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oiler/notes/master/assets/slack-viz-v1.png)

For simplicity of this visual, accept that all of your team (named "pizza") works on all projects together. That's never how things work in reality, but it makes this visual easier to understand if we suspend disbelief on this point. Here's how to read this visual:

* salad team member #4 is working with your team on project 1
* sushi team member #3 needs to ask your team question 
* sandwich team member #1 is a stakeholder on project 2
* all are free to join at will in general purpose channels
* no one is in the cats channel


## Direct Messages
* Be respectful for the number of messages you send in DMs. Group thoughts together. Assume the person you are writing is in the middle of screensharing to a large audience, and they forgot to mute or turn off notifications.
* For example:

This is bad:

`> hi`  
`_(and then wait for a response before you type more)_`

This is also bad:

`> hi`  
`> so`  
`> when you’re free`  
`> can we chat about something`  

This is better:

`> hi so when you're free can we chat about something?`

This is best:

` > hi, when you get a chance can you provide feedback on [link to thing]`


## Chatting in channels

When you need someone's or a group of people's attention, there are various ways to alert them.

In order of magnitude (with the most urgent and widest audience at the top) you should use:

* @channel 
* @here
* @username
* username
* their initials

Use of @ means you need their immediate attention. Using just their username delivers a personalized mention, but with a purposely downgraded sense of urgency attached. Using initials is a great way to about someone who's already in the conversation or who doesn't need to be in it at that time.

With these expectations set across your team, individuals can manage their own ping words and notifications according to their own availability.


## Threads 
It's impossible to expect consistent use of threads.
